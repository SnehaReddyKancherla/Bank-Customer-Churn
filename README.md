# Bank-Customer-Churn
One of the topmost banks in Europe wants to understand their customer data in-detail and trying to extract the patterns causing for customer churn (i.e., bank is losing its existing customers). In order to solve this problem, they have retrieved the customer data from the database which contains the information of both churned and active customers. Project involves a machine learning model that can predict whether the given customer would churn in the near future or not.
